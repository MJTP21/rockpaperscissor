Rock-Paper-Scissors Game 🎮
A simple console-based Rock-Paper-Scissors game developed in C++! This project allows users to play a classic Rock-Paper-Scissors match against the computer, which makes random choices each round.

📋 Project Overview
This project was built to practice and demonstrate basic programming concepts in C++, including:

Random number generation
Conditional logic
Modular function design
The game prompts the user to select Rock, Paper, or Scissors, then generates a random choice for the computer. The winner is determined based on the rules of the game.

🛠️ Features
User Input: Allows the player to enter a choice (1 for Rock, 2 for Paper, or 3 for Scissors).
Computer Choice: Generates a random choice for the computer using rand() and srand() functions.
Win/Lose/Draw Conditions: Determines the result of each round based on player and computer choices.
Modular Code: Organized functions for readability and reusability.
🔧 How It Works
The player selects Rock, Paper, or Scissors by entering a corresponding number.
The computer randomly selects its move.
The program compares both choices and displays the result:
Rock beats Scissors
Paper beats Rock
Scissors beat Paper
A message shows whether the player won, lost, or tied.
